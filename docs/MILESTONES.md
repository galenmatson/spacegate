# Spacegate Milestones (Gaia-First Roadmap)

This document restores and organizes long-range goals, design intent, and idea backlog into a dependency-driven execution plan.

Authoritative architecture and contracts remain in:

- `docs/PROJECT.md`
- `docs/SCHEMA_CORE.md`
- `docs/SLICE_PROFILES.md`
- `docs/SCHEMA_RICH.md` (disc contract; legacy filename)
- `docs/SCHEMA_LORE.md` (rim contract; legacy filename)

## North-Star Product Intent

Spacegate should be:

1. Scientifically trustworthy.
2. Genuinely fun to explore.
3. Useful for both curious non-experts and serious worldbuilders.

### Rule of Cool (Content Prioritization)

High-interest object types should be explicitly prioritized in enrichment and presentation:

- complex multi-star systems
- unusual planets (ultra-short-period, hell worlds, water/ice worlds, eyeball candidates)
- compact-object systems (pulsar planets, exotic remnants)
- nearby "go outside and observe" targets

### Backyard Bonus

Objects visible to amateurs should get special UX treatment:

- practical observing context
- quick-reference viewing notes
- optional telescope guidance where defensible

### Worldbuilding Constraint

Fiction overlays are first-class product features, but must remain fully separated from canonical astronomy.

## Dependency Graph (High Level)

1. Gaia-first canonical `galaxy`
2. Deterministic `core` + `halo` projections and API performance
3. Multiplicity hierarchy reliability
4. Disc factual layer (scores/facts/links)
5. Visual storytelling (snapshots + generated imagery)
6. 3D runtime and deep navigation
7. Rim/worldbuilding tooling
8. Community/engagement overlays

Downstream milestones must not bypass upstream quality gates.

## Milestone Plan

### M0. Baseline Stability (Completed)

Status: largely complete.

Scope:

- reproducible build/promote/verify pipeline
- admin/auth controls
- coolness and snapshots baseline
- operational deployment path

Exit criteria:

- deterministic reruns
- provenance and QC gate enforcement
- stable public serving path

### M1. Gaia Galaxy Backbone Pilot (Current Critical Path)

Goal:

- establish Gaia as canonical star inventory substrate for `<1000 ly` `galaxy`.

Dependencies:

- M0 complete

Deliverables:

- `gaia_backbone` download/cook/ingest path
- immutable `galaxy` artifact contract for build outputs
- quality-tier metadata (`poe`, `ruwe`, astrometry flags)
- `gaia_backbone_report.json` with counts/runtime/storage

Success criteria:

- deterministic repeated builds
- clear quality-band accounting
- acceptable proton runtime/memory envelope

### M2. Core/Halo Product Slice and API Transition

Goal:

- serve fast, stable UX from deterministic `core` with opt-in `halo`.

Dependencies:

- M1 complete

Deliverables:

- `core_product_slice` policy and `halo_complement` materialization
- versioned slice profile catalog and profile selection contract
- profile-scoped SLO gates wired into promotion decisions
- API compatibility review and migration notes
- deep-query mode against `halo`/`galaxy`

Success criteria:

- default API latency targets met
- no functional regressions in search/detail workflows
- explicit documented slice/SLO policy and pass/fail evidence per promoted build

### M3. Multiplicity and Systems-of-Systems

Goal:

- move from flat grouping heuristics to explicit hierarchy confidence.

Dependencies:

- M1, M2 complete

Deliverables:

- NSS/MSC/WDS/ORB6 reintegration on Gaia IDs
- confidence-tiered hierarchy materialization
- parent/child subsystem navigation model

Success criteria:

- benchmark systems (for example Castor-class complexity) improve or hold
- grouping confidence is queryable and user-visible
- conservative defaults avoid silent over-grouping

### M4. Crosswalk and Naming Quality

Goal:

- replace AT-HYG convenience dependence with stronger dedicated crosswalks.

Dependencies:

- M1, M2, M3 complete enough for comparative evaluation

Deliverables:

- replacement alias/ID crosswalk ingestion
- host-match quality verification (planets)
- search/display naming quality parity or improvement

Success criteria:

- no critical identifier regressions
- benchmark lookup ergonomics maintained or improved

### M5. AT-HYG Retirement

Goal:

- remove AT-HYG from canonical inventory path.

Dependencies:

- M4 acceptance criteria met

Deliverables:

- parallel-run comparison report (legacy vs Gaia-first)
- removal of AT-HYG canonical inventory dependence in `galaxy` build path
- cleanup of deprecated code paths/docs

Success criteria:

- objective parity/improvement gates pass
- no production dependency on AT-HYG for canonical rows

### M5.5 Planet Taxonomy and Habitability

Goal:

- classify planets with observation-grounded tags and expose a deterministic habitability ranking/search surface.

Dependencies:

- M2 and M3 stable
- M4 host/crosswalk quality accepted
- exoplanet lifecycle ingestion policy active (`confirmed`, `candidate`, `controversial`, `retracted`)

Deliverables:

- lifecycle materialization and pruning policy:
  - `candidate` included by default
  - `controversial` stored but default-off via UI/API toggle
  - `retracted` excluded from science defaults, retained as tombstoned provenance for audit and rim references
- planet taxonomy tagger using observational/derived science fields (for example):
  - size/mass class (`sub-Earth`, `super-Earth`, `mini-Neptune`, `Neptune`, `Jovian`, `super-Jovian`)
  - insolation/temperature class (`hot`, `warm`, `cold`, inferno/ice thresholds)
  - orbital class (`USP`, short/long period, eccentric, circumbinary when evidenced)
  - detection-method tags and host-context tags
- Spacegate habitability scorer (`spacegate_hab_score`) with confidence and reason flags
- searchable score controls:
  - habitability slider
  - quick query for top-N most habitable planets
- comparison report against external habitability references (for example HWC) without delegating canonical score ownership

Success criteria:

- taxonomy tags are deterministic and reproducible across rebuilds
- lifecycle toggles and pruning behavior are auditable and reversible via lineage
- default product views match policy (`candidate` on, `controversial` off, `retracted` hidden)
- habitability ranking query latency remains within core slice SLO targets

### M6. External Links and Factual Disc Layer

Goal:

- provide deeper exploration context with strict factual grounding.

Dependencies:

- M2+ stable

Deliverables:

- curated external reference links (authority allowlist)
- structured factsheets with provenance pointers
- exposition generation from factsheets with factuality guardrails

Success criteria:

- no uncited generated claims in user-facing exposition
- clear model/version/prompt provenance

### M7. Visual Storytelling Expansion

Goal:

- extend deterministic snapshots into richer but traceable generated visuals.

Dependencies:

- M6 factual layer

Deliverables:

- snapshot coverage expansion policy
- generated image pipeline with prompt/provenance storage
- confidence/accuracy labeling for generated visualizations and animations

Success criteria:

- deterministic artifact identity and reproducibility metadata
- explicit user-visible confidence tags

### M8. 3D Map Runtime

Goal:

- deliver a performant, navigable browser 3D map over Gaia-first slice/backbone.

Dependencies:

- M2, M3, M6 foundationally complete

Deliverables:

- browser 3D viewer (camera controls, selection, tooltips)
- level-of-detail strategy and floating-origin handling
- system detail navigation from map selection

Success criteria:

- interactive performance on mid-tier consumer hardware
- stable object selection and context handoff to detail views

### M9. Rim and Worldbuilding Tooling

Goal:

- support creative overlays without contaminating scientific core.

Dependencies:

- M8 map/runtime baseline

Deliverables:

- rim namespace/entity tooling
- map-editable overlay primitives:
  - trade lanes
  - spacegate links
  - spheres of control
  - megastructure placement

Success criteria:

- strict data-layer separation enforced
- rim operations do not mutate core/disc canonical science rows

### M10. Engagement and Community Overlay

Goal:

- incorporate public curiosity signals safely and transparently.

Dependencies:

- M6+ mature enough to prioritize enrichment from demand signals

Deliverables:

- privacy-safe engagement schema
- ranking overlays and public profile presets (non-canonical)
- moderation and abuse controls for shared overlays

Success criteria:

- no personal tracking creep
- canonical scientific ranking remains isolated from social overlays by design

## Idea Backlog (Restored and Organized)

These are preserved product ideas from earlier planning notes, reordered by likely dependency:

### Enrichment and Discovery

- prioritize exotic, high-narrative systems for early enrichment
- "Backyard bonus" fast-path for observable nearby targets
- highlight category-based discovery paths (habitable candidates, inferno worlds, compact-object systems)

### Visualization and Image Direction

- system-level generated visuals centered on dominant dynamics
- planet-level generated views (global and speculative surface interpretation)
- explicit captions describing known data vs inferred visualization elements

### Map and Interaction

- deep hierarchy navigation (system -> subsystem -> component)
- confidence-aware animation controls with visible parameterization
- optional orbit/motion projection controls over long timescales

### Worldbuilding Features

- worldbuilder overlays for:
  - trade lanes
  - imperial borders/spheres
  - infrastructure/megaproject annotations
- free-floating rim entities not anchored to real objects

### Restored Concept Notes (Curated from Prior Backlog)

- System rendering priorities:
  - emphasize complex and exotic systems in default discovery surfaces
  - center close binaries/planetary dynamics while still depicting distant companions
  - preserve scientific grounding while allowing visibility-oriented exaggeration in derived visuals
- Planet visualization motif set (derived, clearly labeled as inferred):
  - volcanic worlds
  - water worlds
  - ice worlds
  - desert worlds
  - hell worlds
  - acid worlds
  - ringed worlds
  - dead worlds
- Generated media UX ideas:
  - shareable captioned outputs
  - confidence/accuracy badge on every generated artifact
  - prompt/provenance tooltip visibility
  - optional popularity ranking in non-canonical experience layers
- Worldbuilding object examples to retain in rim layer planning:
  - solar collectors
  - foundries
  - shipyards
  - Dyson swarms
  - colonies
  - momentum banks
  - space elevators
  - mines and mass drivers
  - stations and gates
- Community-facing backlog (non-canonical):
  - public coolness profile presets
  - community ranking overlays isolated from canonical science ranking

## Governance Rule

No milestone in M6+ should compromise M1-M5 scientific integrity gates.

If there is conflict:

1. protect core correctness
2. keep derived content explicitly labeled
3. delay feature launch rather than blur canonical truth boundaries
