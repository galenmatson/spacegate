# Retention Policy

This policy governs Spacegate build artifacts in `$SPACEGATE_STATE_DIR`.

## Scope

- `out/<build_id>/` immutable build artifacts (`core.duckdb`, `arm.duckdb`, parquet, disc outputs)
- `reports/<build_id>/` per-build reports

Out of scope (never pruned by retention script):

- `raw/` catalog downloads
- `cooked/` normalized catalog exports
- `reports/manifests/` source manifests

## Default Policy

- Keep the currently served build (`served/current`) regardless of age.
- Keep newest 6 build directories in `out/`.
- Keep newest 12 per-build report directories in `reports/`.
- Remove stale temporary ingest paths (`out/*.tmp`).

## Scripted Cleanup

Use:

```bash
scripts/prune_state_retention.sh
```

This is dry-run by default. To apply:

```bash
scripts/prune_state_retention.sh --apply
```

Useful overrides:

```bash
scripts/prune_state_retention.sh --keep-builds 8 --keep-reports 16 --apply
scripts/prune_state_retention.sh --no-prune-tmp
```

## Operational Notes

- If artifacts were created by root-owned container processes, run cleanup with appropriate permissions.
- Run retention after successful promotion/verification, not during ingest.
- If large one-off caches (for example external catalog mirrors) are stored under the state root, move them outside `out/` and `reports/` so retention remains deterministic.
