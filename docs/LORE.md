I've worked for a long time on a fictional scifi universe, drawing elaborate star maps of trade lanes. While the entire universe is fully hard scifi and sublight until 2500 or so, for space opera and grand adventure I had to make a concession for faster than light travel. 

The system uses space contraction between two 'spacegates' at different points in space. The spacegates, separated by several light years, must achieve an unfathomably perfect alignment and synchronization and both must annihilate a prohibitively expensive amount of antimatter. 

The antimatter requirement increases quadratically with distance. Jumps between far systems are extremely expensive and infrequent whereas close or clustered systems are better connected. Jump distances are generally limited to around 4 or 5 light years. There should be no absolute limit but economics would exclude jumps over 11 light years or so. 

This does leave a lot of systems outside the FTL network (but there's a substantial amount of STL (< .2 c) traffic). While the breakthroughs behind the spacegates are known by the mid 2100s the energy requirement is so extravagant that economically beneficial interstellar FTL isn't available until energy production rises to meet it. And that is basically done by damming starlight with massive solar arrays that generate antimatter. 

The surface area requirements result in dyson swarms of solar collectors around the brightest stars, with the antimatter production for the same collector area rising with the Stephan Boltzman law, making bright A, B, and O type stars the most desirable for energy production. They fuel the spacegates and antimatter rocket based sublight interstellar travel and form the energy core of empires in the future. 

## Industrialization
These objects should be definable so I can create immense solar collectors that output 1 gram of antimatter per year or something like that. Or a mine that produces x kilotons of 18% aluminum 12% iron ore per day. And an ore processor that separataes and concentrates that to 78% grade aluminum ore and 68% iron ore. And an aluminum smelter that outputs x amount of pure aluminum. And a foundry that outputs x tons of steel per day. And a space elevator that can bring x tons up to orbit per day. And a ship yard that consumes x tons of aluminum per day as it produces a ship that contains x tons of aluminum and steel. For example.


# Lore Maps
For fans of scifi set in the actual Milky Way (sorry Star Wars), map soverign space in popular science fiction.
## Franchises with Real Star Lore
- Star Trek
- Dune
- Battletech
- Babylon 5
- Elite Dangerous
- The Expanse
There's certainly more. The lore functionality should be robust enough for users to map just about any franchise they're into.
