Most star maps are toys; this is a mad astronomer's observatory. 

This project builds a 'lab bench' for the galaxy by merging scattered astronomical catalogs 
into a single, cohesive database. It solves the 'dirty data' problem of interstellar 
mapping—resolving cross-catalog duplicates, normalizing orbital mechanics, and 
providing a stable foundation for procedural generation, trade route simulation, and 
hard sci-fi storytelling.
